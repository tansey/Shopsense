API Overview
The ShopStyle API allows client applications to retrieve the underlying data for all the basic elements of the ShopStyle websites, including products, brands, retailers, categories, and looks. For ease of development, the API is a REST-style web service, composed of simple HTTP GET requests. Data is returned to the client in either XML or JSON formats. The API is client-language independent and easy to use from PHP, Java, JavaScript, or any other modern development context.

To use the ShopStyle API, you need to first sign up here to get your unique API key. Once you have this key, you can start making the API calls described below.

Intended Audience
This document is intended for programmers who would like to develop a client application that will use the ShopStyle API. The client will need to know how to invoke an HTTP request with a particular URL and process the body of the response as either XML or JSON.

How to Use the API
Here are the basic steps for using the API, regardless of the client language you are using:

Choose the method that returns the data your application needs. For example, the apiSearch method is used to get products that match a given category or brand.
Construct a URL for that method with the appropriate host, method name, and query parameters.
Invoke the URL as an HTTP GET.
When the HTTP response arrives, extract the required data elements from the response's body.
The rest of this document describes the details of constructing the right URL for each of the API's methods. The XML format of the responses may be seen by clicking on the sample URLs shown for each method. The responses in JSON format contain identical information, just in a different language.

There is also a sample client application written in PHP.

ShopStyle API URLs
All ShopStyle API URLs have the following form:

http://api.shopstyle.com/action/METHOD_NAME?pid=uid9316-2194146-60&format=FORMAT&site=SITE&...
The METHOD_NAME is taken from the list of methods in the API shown at left.

Common API Parameters
All methods in the API accept these parameters:

pid	Unique API_KEY string that is assigned to the caller. Sign up here to get your Shopstyle API key. This parameter must be present.
format

The format of the response. Supported values are:
xml - The response is in XML format with UTF-8 encoding. This is the default if the parameter is absent.
json - The response is in JSON format with UTF-8 encoding.
json2 - Same as json, but numbers and booleans are returned as JSON numbers and booleans instead of strings.
jsonvar - The response is in JSON format with UTF-8 encoding and includes a JavaScript assignment statement. This is useful when the API URL is the src attribute of a script tag, as the result is stored in a variable that can be used by subsequent JavaScript code.
jsonvar2 - Same as jsonvar, but numbers and booleans are returned as JSON numbers and booleans instead of strings.
jsonp - The response is in JSON format with UTF-8 encoding wrapped in a JavaScript method called padding. The padding must be specified with the query parameter 'callback'. Only single expressions (function reference, or object property function reference) are accepted as valid paddings.
rss - The response is an RSS feed (beta).
site	Specifies the ShopStyle website to be searched or queried (optional; defaults to US fashion).
www.shopstyle.com — provides access to US fashion and home products.
www.shopstyle.co.uk — provides access to UK fashion products.
Product Query Parameters
Many of the methods listed in the next section accept this set of optional product query parameters, which are similar to query parameters used by the ShopStyle websites:

fts	Text search terms, as a user would enter in a Search: field.
cat	A product category. Only products within the category will be returned. The easiest way to find values for this parameter is to browse to a category on the ShopStyle website and take the last element of the URL path, e.g., from http://www.shopstyle.com/browse/dresses, use "dresses." Another way is to look at the categories of the products returned by the apiSearch or to look at the list of categories from apiGetCategoryHistogram.
fl	
Specify one or more filters on the query for brand, retailer, price, discount, and/or size. Each filter value has an initial letter and a numeric id. The easiest way to construct a filter list is to do a search on ShopStyle, select one or more filters in the UI, and copy the resulting URL. To convert brand or retailer names to ids, use the apiGetBrands and apiGetRetailers calls. Here is a sample URL showing sale clothing from two brands and one retailer:

http://www.shopstyle.com/browse/womens-clothes?fl=d0&fl=b3510&fl=b689&fl=r21

Filter prefixes are:

b - brand
r - retailer
p - price
d - sale
s - size
c - color
pdd	A "price drop date" expressed as a number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970. If present, limits the results to products whose price has dropped since the given date.
prodid	The id of a specific product to return. This may be specified multiple times to get many products in one response.

##########
apiSearch
This method returns a set of products that match a query, specified using the product query parameters and those listed below.
http://api.shopstyle.com/action/apiSearch?pid=uid9316-2194146-60&fts=red+dress&min=0&count=10
min	The index of the first product to return, or 0 (zero) if not specified. A client can use this to implement paging through large result sets.
count	The maximum number of results to return, or 20 if not specified. The maximum value is 250. Combine with the min parameter to implement paging.
Response
A list of Product objects. Each Product has an id, name, description, price, retailer, brand name, categories, images in small/medium/large, and a URL that forwards to the retailer's site.
Note: To view the response xml or json, copy an API link and paste it in your browser after replacing YOUR_API_KEY with the api key assigned to you.

########

Response
A list of Category objects. Each Category has an id, name, and count of the number of query results in that category.

########
apiGetFilterHistogram
This method returns a list of filters and product counts that describe the results of a given product query. The query is specified using the product query parameters.

An easy way to get a look's ID is to go to the Stylebook page that contains the look at the ShopStyle website and right-click on the button that you use to edit the look. From the popup menu, select "Copy Link" and paste that into any text editor. The "lookId" query parameter of that URL is the value to use for this API method.

Response
A list of looks of the given type. Each look has the fields listed above (see apiGetLook).

##############
apiVisitRetailer
This method does not return a reponse of XML or JSON data like the other elements of the API. Instead, it forwards the user to the retailer's product page for a given product. It is the typical behavior to offer when the user clicks on a product. The apiSearch method returns URLs that call this method for each of the products it returns.

The "id" query parameter of that URL is the value to use for this API method.

##############
apiGetTrends
This method returns the popular brands for a given category along with a sample product for the brand-category combination.
http://www.shopstyle.com/action/apiGetTrends?pid=uid9316-2194146-60&cat=109
cat	Category you want to restrict the popularity search for. This is an optional parameter. If category is not supplied, all the popular brands regardless of category will be returned.
